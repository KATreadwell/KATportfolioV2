# KATportfolioV2

This is my portfolio using a free bootstrap theme that I downloaded.  The spacing is a bit too generous and I'm not sure about the teal color.  Also, when clicking on an image in the Portfolio section, it does indeed take you to the game but only if you click on the text- not just anywhere on the image.  Will try to fix later.  

Also template had instructions on how to connect the Contact form to web server but I got a cross-reference error.  Will attempt again later.
